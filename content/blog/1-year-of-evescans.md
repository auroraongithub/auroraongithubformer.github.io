Making a scanlation group and somehow have it still going even after a year to me is an absurd feat, knowing I'm the type of person who has hobbies that mostly last a month or few, if lucky. In a year, we went from 20 members in the first week, to 800 in 6 months, and approximately 1,250 members in a year. The rate of the group's growth in just a year is insane to me, and I hope that I, together with the group, will grow in the future years to come. As the end of the year draws near, I'd like to say that this has been one of the best years of my life (in the scanlation space).
