Okay, I actually got them a day ago but it still counts.

# I GOT MY FIRST LIGHT NOVEL (ever)

The light novel(s) `(since there are four of them...)` that I bought is FUNA's "I Shall Survive Using Potions!". It's about a person named Kaoru Nagase who basically gets ULTRAKILLâ„¢-ed by a distortion due to other world lines (parallel worlds, multiverses, whatever you wanna call it) that was fixed too late, and she became the only casualty. Then the God of Earth basically tried to compensate for his mistake and offered to reincarnate her in another less culturally advanced world, as doing so in her former world would collapse the world's balance. And accept she did and then the story goes on from there. Though she said goodbye in her two friends' and family's dreams for a few minutes before actually leaving (foreshadowing).

Currently there are 8 volumes and more to count (7 translated to English and have physical copies while the eighth is only an EBook for now), and I bought four of them. I read all eight volumes in an EBook form that I obtained through *other means* but after some time I finally got the chance to get physical copies. I had initially planned to buy six but that'd drain all the money I've earned for this month. So I'll be gradually collecting all the volumes as time passes. I highly recommend you to read this light novel if you want a fun and exciting story, with interesting situations and funny interactions between characters. Overall, it's a fun read to pass time if you have some.
