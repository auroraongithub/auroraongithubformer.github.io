**Prologue**

**“Everything will come to an end—but you shall prevent that end.”** I recall a dream I had last night. All I can remember in that dream was that... I was staring into the darkness, floating in the void, and then hearing a voice out of nowhere.

The voice neither sounded like a boy nor a girl. *Who was that? Was that a person? What will come to an end?* A bunch of questions pop into my head when I remember what the mysterious person said. This situation feels like a novel plot.

—I wonder as I try processing the sight of Natsuki’s body laying on the floor, drenched in blood. Akari was a cute, cheerful, happy girl that would infect others with her positivity. She doesn’t look like the kind of person who’d do this. But in front of me is my friend, now a cold, dead body, stabbed by that same “cheerful, happy girl”.

Most of our classmates immediately ran, scared that they would be stabbed next, some stood still, trying to process what happened, though after a while, they ran. I gag in my mouth because of the terrible sight right in front of me.

*I gotta run.*

Part of me wants to know the reason why Akari did it. Is it because of family problems?  Did she actually hate Natsuki? If so, what did Natsuki do for her to hate him? I start to think of many possible reasons, yet none of them feel right. She never showed anything of the sort, after all. If she was able to hide all of that until now, she’d be a world-class actor.

I’m probably crazy for thinking about asking a murderer about why they did what they did. Not that she should be forgiven though. 

“Akari...what-”

I try to ask her, with a trembling voice. My legs are about to give out. I couldn’t handle something as crazy as this happening out of the blue. But I gathered my resolve. 

And as soon as I was about to finish my sentence, she said something under her breath, but I couldn't hear it. She put the knife she was holding to her neck and killed herself. The sight made me cry. *What did she say?* I wonder, while my legs give up in shock, staring at the lifeless bodies of Natsuki and Akari. *I feel sick.* As I see the clock in the classroom slowly starting to move backward, I lose consciousness.

**Chapter 1 - The “Beginning”**

June 6. I’m walking on my way to school. I arrive ten minutes early and sit on my chair. The classroom slowly fills up with students. The day officially starts. A few announcements were made during homeroom. The first period’s History. *I’m bored.*

But the day’s going normally. I’m completely satisfied with this. Normal days are the best, *I don’t have to keep thinking about stuff.* I thought to myself.

Math class starts. I take some notes because it’s one of my weaker subjects. Five minutes before lunch break. Everyone’s yawning, whispering to their seatmates, getting ready to eat lunch. 
The bell rings and lunch break begins. I take my lunch out of my bag. As I was about to start eating, a person approached me. It’s Hikari. She’s one of those people who always get the top grades in our class. Actually, she *almost* always gets the top grade. But she always makes blunders in her tests, keeping her from getting the highest score. Hikari’s been my friend since grade school. I guess if we’ve been together for that long, we could almost be called childhood friends. 

“Sup, Kai.” Hikari says with a gentle smile.

“Hi.”

“What’s your lunch?”

She always asks what my lunch is, and she takes the chance to ask me for it if she wants some.
“Omelet.”

“Ooh, can I have some?” Hikari asks, brimming with excitement. Maybe eggs are her secret to being really smart.

“Yeah, sure.”

Hikari loves eggs. No, she loves it *too much*. She’d give me her entire lunch just for anything that’s egg-related. I won’t let her do that though. As I was about to give her my omelet, someone else calls out to me—

—It’s Natsuki. He’s been a friend of mine since my first year of high school. We met each other because I tripped on absolutely nothing and he helped me out. Our friendship progressed naturally after that. Unlike Hikari, Natsuki doesn’t have outstanding grades, but he could get to the top if he tried. He proved it during our last test, where he got almost a perfect score on every subject. I guess Hikari and Natsuki are alike in a way.

“Ooh? What’s this about?” Natsuki smirks.

“What?”

“Did you two finally start going out? You’re at the point where you can feed her out in the open now, huh? Look at him, he’s finally made a move~”

Natsuki says with a face that screams “*hoho-*”.

*That’s an annoying look on his face. Wait. “Feed her out in the open”?* I ask myself, only to see Hikari opening her mouth, waiting for me to put the food I picked up in her mouth.

Oh. That’s why. I immediately had to reply.

“Please stop that, you know there’s no way we’re going out.”

I responded in a polite way, with a slightly angry tone in my voice. The way I replied was so unusual that even Natsuki got frightened.

“Woah, alright, sorry. You’re real scary when you reply with that tone.”

Natsuki says while laughing.

*I feel like this exact situation has happened before.* Arriving ten minutes early, the topics we discussed, the conversation we’re having right now. Somewhere, in the back of my mind, I’m sure something crazy’s gonna happen today.

“What’s wrong, Kai?” Natsuki asks me, probably noticing I was staring into space.

But I ignored his question.

I get the feeling like I’m missing something really important. *What was it?* But I gave up thinking. *It’s probably only my imagination. Maybe I’m overthinking it.* 

What happened afterwards immediately proved me wrong. A girl’s scream can be heard across the classroom. A person drops dead, covering the floor with blood. Their organs peek out, making a really unpleasant view. Unpleasant wouldn’t even describe how ugly and disgusting this view is. *This definitely happened before. But I feel like the person who died isn’t the same as last time.* But I was sure the person holding the knife was the same. It was Akari. 

I have no clue why everything feels familiar. I’m supposed to feel like vomiting, shaking, terrified of the sight before me, but I’m not, as if I’ve seen this many times before. I wanted to ask why she did it, but before I could say anything, she said something under her breath. I couldn’t hear it again. *Wait, again? Just what did she say?* I wonder, as I somehow calmly stare at the people panicking, watching the chaos happening inside the classroom.

---

June 6. I’m walking on my way to school. I thought about this weird dream before I woke up. *“Everything will come to an end—but you shall prevent that end.”* Hm? Haven’t I heard that before? I keep walking to school and arrive ten minutes early. The first period’s  History. *I’m bored.* The current period’s Math. Someone stands abruptly, holding a knife across the classroom, and stabs one of my classmates out of the blue like it was nothing. The seatmate of the person who got stabbed screamed at the knife inside of their seatmate’s body. The knife was then pulled out from the body with a swift motion. *Why’d she kill someone again? Didn’t that happen too early?* My thoughts stopped for a moment, shocked at what I thought of. 

*—That’s it. This must’ve happened multiple times. But am I the only one who knows? Did it happen so many times that I just stopped reacting to it, brushing it off like it was nothing? Because I unconsciously knew it’d happen again?* I asked myself a couple of questions, knowing I wouldn’t be able to answer them. But I eventually pieced it together and came to a realization. *Oh. It’s gotta be because of that dream.*  I look at the person holding the knife. It was Akari. Akari then said something that I couldn’t hear again and killed herself.

**???th Loop**

June 6. I’m walking on my way to school. But something’s different this time. I have memories of what happened before the day repeated itself again. I still don’t know how many times I’ve already gone through this day. I may have gone through this a million times and I wouldn’t have known. I keep running to school, panicking, wanting to know the cause of this abnormal situation. No, abnormal is an understatement, it’s supernatural. 

As soon as I arrive at school, I immediately try to find Akari to ask her why she’s doing all of this killing, still unsure if it was only a delusion or a dream. I ran around the campus for about 5 minutes, and I found her sitting on the staircase. 5 more minutes before classes start. Though there’s the possibility of her stabbing me out of the blue, I gather my resolve and ask her.

“Yo.”

She looks at me with empty, dead eyes. And I ask her in the most direct way possible. There wasn’t any time to waste.

“What were you doing?”

Akari looks surprised by what I said. But she immediately recovers her composure and replies in a seemingly cheerful way.

“What do you mean? I dunno what you’re talking about.”

Akari replies with dead eyes as if her soul’s being broken by the second. It’s painful to watch her pretend she’s fine.

I guess there’s no choice. *I need to be as straightforward as possible.*

“I remember what you did before today repeated again. I don’t remember the times before that, but I’m pretty sure it happened multiple times.”

Akari’s eyes widened, then her face changed into a sad look, and replied,

“I see.”

Before I let her say anything more, I had one question I really needed to be answered. 
“...Have you killed me before?”

She flinches, so that must mean she has.

“Why?”

”I guess I have no other choice but to tell you. But before that, how do you remember what I did? You aren’t supposed to remember.”

Akari asks, tilting her head in confusion. I had a reason that immediately went on top of my head, but I wasn’t sure if it really was the cause.

“Maybe... Because I had a weird dream.” 

As soon as she heard of this, she showed a face mixed with worry and relief.

“...I did too. That’s why I’m trying to find the culprit behind the day repeating.”

*...What?* She thinks the culprit’s within the school, but why?

“Why do you think they’re in this school?”

“Well, if you got caught in a time loop situation, you’d always check the places with the people that would know who you are, right?”

“You’re not wrong. Did you initially not kill people out of the blue though?”

“Yeah. There’s no way I could do that unless there wasn’t any other option.”

Akari exhaled loudly, looking exhausted. Like she’s lost all hope. She must’ve gone through this more times than I know.

*Hmm...* I scratch my head, trying to think of a way to get us out of this mess.

Akari looked scared and hesitant, but then she said something that would end my normal days.

**“Uno.”**

That word “unlocked” a bunch of memories I didn’t know were there. It felt like my mind was gonna explode. Just when I thought I knew that the dream was probably the reason this was happening, I haven’t actually uncovered who was behind that dream. It unlocked everything that happened in the other timelines like a secret cheat code. I don’t even know who or what “Uno” is.

As all the “memories” were flashing back in my head, I recalled that she was killing every single person in the school, and she was about to finish up by doing it to the entire classroom. In one of my “memories”, she declared in front of the entire class that if she couldn’t find the culprit, she would either give up or search outside the school, until she has killed every single person on the planet, just so that she could find the culprit and escape. She knew that whatever she did, it wouldn’t change anything, because nobody would remember it anyway. *So that’s why she was killing everyone. *

In the past loops, I was observing her because apparently, I was able to recall the other retries like what happened to me just now and I also worked together with her before. Though I forgot about it. So I was able to remember what she was doing before she tried to kill everyone.

Initially, she would observe every little detail that happens today. Then she tried a more direct approach by asking everybody about it, to no avail. Akari repeated this day so many times, to the point that she’s about to break and resort to killing people. Once you kill someone, you can’t turn back. Actually, if she was killing people out of nowhere, maybe she already broke. Luckily she can still hold a conversation.

“But why were you killing yourself too?”

“......Because if I don’t, one important person to me will vanish. It’s gonna keep happening until I have nobody left. The day’s gonna repeat anyways, so I can go ahead and kill myself all I need.”

I never knew about this, nor do I remember her telling me about it in the other loops. That means there might be a new opportunity this time. But Akari looked like she was about to cry, scared for her life, not wanting to lose those important to her.

“Why me, of all people...?”

Akari says to herself, not having a single change in her expression like she’s given up. The cheerful, happy girl, Akari, is now broken.

That struck a chord with me. I felt a strong desire to help her, to get herーno, the both of us out of this mess. 

“Let’s work together.”

Akari didn’t react.

“I’ll help you get out of this.”

“You said that more than a hundred times before. And you forgot every single time. I’ve given up.” Akari responds with a hint of anger in her voice, and she starts trembling, about to cry.

“I’ll help you. Give me one more chance.”

As I say these words, Akari finally breaks down, unable to keep up the strong girl front anymore.
“......This is what I hate about you...” Akari answers me while crying, but she nods afterward.

---

“So, do you know how many times the day repeated?”

Curious to know how many times she’s gone through today before to drive her into this state, I ask.

“Roughly 7400 times. I’m not sure. I lost the exact count halfway.”

Akari’s eyes were red from bawling her eyes out.

“Alright, let’s start from there then. Have you ever thought of other ways to find the culprit other than killing them? Are you sure it’s not some extraterrestrial being that’s doing this?”

“Hehe, I’m sure it isn’t. After all, I spoke with Uno.”

Akari giggled, her mood lightened by the words I said. But-

“...You spoke with Uno?”

“Mmm, a couple times, actually. Uno was pretty friendly, you know.”

*What. Are you kidding me?*

“Is Uno the “person” in our dreams?”

*Wait, is “Uno” even a person?*

“Yeah, Uno pretty much told me right away before we started discussing anything else. They said they forgot to tell us in our dreams about it.”

“Huh. So I guess something that’s capable of talking to us in our dreams can forget too. So what’d they say?”

Akari stays silent for a second.

“They didn’t tell me to not tell you, so I guess it’s fine. Basically, they wanted to mess with you a bit, by saying something that sounds like foreshadowing but forgot to tell you that I also got caught up in this mess and that the culprit’s in the school, something like that.”

“WHAT HAPPENED TO “always checking the places with the people that would know who you are”!? YOU’RE SAYING UNO JUST TOLD YOU!?”

*ARE YOU MESSING WITH ME!!?? They forgot to tell me something THAT IMPORTANT!?* Still, it doesn’t change the fact that I got involved in this craziness multiple times...

“Okay, sorry ‘bout that, so... Why’s it always me who gets involved with you?”

“Who knows?”

Akari’s complexity brightened a bit, but she hears the bell that tells us classes are about to start and goes back to looking sad. *Here it comes.*

I had another question for her, but I decided to save it until lunchtime.

The classes went on as usual. I’m still shocked how Natsuki’s still here alive and unharmed like nothing happened. But that’s just how time loops work.

The bell rings, signaling that it’s lunchtime, and as I was about to approach her, she stabs a classmate, says something, and kills herself with her knife. I thought that after our exchange in the morning, she’d stop. But I remembered,

*“...I did too. That’s why I’m trying to find the culprit behind today repeating.”*

*“......Because if I don’t, one important person to me will vanish. It’s gonna keep happening until I have nobody left. The day’s gonna repeat anyways, so I can go ahead and kill myself all I need.”*

So I recalled my memories, and now I know what she said—

“Not this one.”

And once again, the clock goes backwards, slowly getting faster.

7401st Loop

I wake up, laying on my bed. I remember as clear as night and day what happened yesterday. *No, it wasn’t yesterday. This stuff’s so confusing.* It’s crazy how I don’t feel anything after what just happened. I’m sure it’s because I know nobody’s dead for real when they get killed. Maybe they’re dead in other timelines though, but let’s not think too deeply about that.

I remind myself that it’s June 6. After all those loops, it probably became a habit of mine along the way. *I wonder what my mental age is right now...*

I walk to school at a faster pace than usual, arrive 20 minutes early, and try to find Akari as fast as I can to discuss our game plan. Or that was supposed to be the plan.  I find her, sitting on the staircase, like before. Akari notices me and calls out to me first.

“Kai.”

I was a bit surprised that she called out first.

“Yes?”

“I hope you know why I did it.”

“...Yeah.”

There’s a bit of awkwardness between us right now, probably because of what happened.

“...I’ll head to the classroom.”

“Same. I might do it again, so I hope you’re fine with it.”

“Yeah.”

We both head to the classroom, not saying a single word to each other.

The day progresses as usual, just like how I remember it.

It’s lunchtime. *Here it comes.*

Akari pulls out a knife, stabs it into a classmate, but when I see her looking at the person she stabbed, she looks shocked for a moment. The corner of her mouth rises a bit, but this time, she doesn't say anything—and kills herself.
